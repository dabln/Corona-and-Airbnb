## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. Exception: the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk).  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I use Airbnb data from 2019-2020 to answer these questions:

1. What is the Corona impact on Airbnb's demand in Berlin?
2. How do the hosts react to the Corona virus?
3. For those who travel in Corona times: how happy are they with the stay?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one Jupyter notebook (file extension .ipynb) with the analysis of the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process.  

Details for the CSV files used are given in the notebook and below under licensing.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://janhenner.medium.com/this-is-how-corona-affects-airbnb-in-berlin-f8ceb40c711b).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The data was obtained from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html where the licensing for the data can be found. Feel free to use the code as you like, or more explicitly it's provided under the "GNU General Public License".
